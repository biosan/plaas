# Plaas

**Pl**ots **a**s **a** **s**ervice (XKCD style)

## How it works

Plaas is composed of a very simple API and an even simpler web page.

The backend is build with Falcon, a minimalist an wicked fast framework for Python.
Plots are generated by the fantastic MatPlotLib library with XKCD style.

The frontend is a simple HTML plus some bits of JS, all styled thanks to Bulma.
